# ETF_Portfolio_Construction

This is a personal project of mine where I construct a portfolio by optimizing sharpe ratio and use a multivariate garch model to estimate the variance-covariance matrix.

loaddata.R loads data using the package quantmod.
model_fitting.R fits the multivariate garch model.
Writeup.Rmd summarizes results.
